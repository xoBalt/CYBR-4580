#Initial Questions

These are questions we would like to ask our Technical Director, Joshua Lyle, as we assemble our formal project proposal.

- What type of data is meant to be sent?
- For the proof of concept, can we assume that we only control the two endpoints that are communicating and not the intermediary  infrastructure? 
- Are there particular communication channels of interest? (Cellular, WiFi, DSL, Radio)
- Any opinion on splitting data streams between ISPs as an obfuscation measure?
- On a spectrum of lightweight package to covering many specific use cases, where should we be aiming?
- What information can you give us about past projects and what you liked or didn't like about them?
